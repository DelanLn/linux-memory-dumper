# What is this... thing?
This is a script which dumps as much allocated memory as possible from a running Linux system. The primary target is user data, which is what most forensic investigations target.

# How does it work?
By parsing /proc/<pid>/maps and dumping the regions described in there from /proc/<pid>/mem.

# Does it need root?
No! However, the success rate is significantly more limited when you run it as an unprivileged user. I still managed to pull quite a bit of information out running it under my normal unprivileged account.

# Why?
For a forensics class, and generally because there's a lack of memory dumping utilities for Linux these days since /dev/mem was deprecated.

# Limitations
This script collects its list of PIDs at start-up, and then scans through each one. The process takes a while. By the time it makes it to a given process it may have died, and by the time it finishes new processes may have spawned. Since the goal of this script is to collect data from longer-running processes such as web browsers and editors, I don't consider this a huge issue. Any competent forensic examiner uses this script alongside other techniques such as disk imaging anyway.

It's slow as balls right now, I think because access to /proc is slow on my system, which is pretty up-to-date (kernel 3.8.4) probably because the kernel generates maps files and such on the fly.

It probably will not obtain dm-crypt encryption keys, as those are likely to be stored in the memory of kernel threads, but those can easily be obtained (if you have root) with "dmsetup table --showkeys". Like I said, there's a whole array of steps you'd want to run on a system you're examining, and this tool is only one of them, and does not attempt to be a one-stop forensics tool.

# Disclaimer
I've written this utility in good faith. It's open source, you can see exactly how it gathers its data, and you can go back to the Linux kernel docs or even the kernel source to examine its behavior. All this said, I cannot and will not be held liable for any inaccurate results returned by this tool, nor is any warranty provided (please see the license below).

Also, if you are a forensic examiner, please do not exclude the possibility that a smart enemy/target has modified their kernel to lie about memory regions or lie in /proc/<pid>/mem. It's pretty easy to do.
